# Sticks 
### A Q-learning example

The goal of this repository is to create an environment where a computer 
program learns how to play and hopefully win (or at least not lose) at the game of sticks. The rules of the game are
summed up nicely [here](https://frugalfun4boys.com/play-sticks-finger-game-kids/).

The learning method this program will use is Q-Learning.  For an explanation on 
Q-learning checkout this [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZbbT5o_s2xoWNVdDudn51XM8lOuZ_Njv) 
by the awesome folks at DeepLizard.  I have no connection to Deeplizard at all. I'm not getting a kickback or anything.
I just think they are great and produce very high quality content. 

The todo list for this project is too long to print here.

To run tests use unittest from the tests directory
$ python -m unittest

For code coverage run coverage and then reports

$ coverage report
